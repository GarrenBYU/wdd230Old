          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>The purpose of this site and group is to promote growth and development within the individuals living in or near Provo/Utah County and not just in the community. This will be done through job listings and buisness ventures that are hapening around these areas. The idea behind this is to finally wash out everything that happened with Covid and get this community up and running and provide a place for those that still need the support to get their buisnesses, lives, and families back to normal through jobs, activities, and promotions.</p>
