            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>This site is meant for everyone in the Provo and Utah County region, but I really want this to reach out to everyone that are still struggling after the effects of covid. Those looking for support in their lives like jobs or activities in the community. The unemployment rate in Utah has decreased and is currently at 2%, but the point is to be ready for the next disaster and to get everyone else that can have a job with a job.</p>
            <p>I also want it to be a space for buisnesses and others to start really getting out there again. During Covid we found that the future is on the internet and they can do many of their job processes online. Not to mention all of the entreprenuers that couldn't get out during covid could now have a chance due to this website and community. This leads them to need a way to get out there. And I want The Snow Capped Chamber to be the place for that to happen.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Scenarios</h3>
            <p>You are a struggling parent in their 30s that recently lost their job due to budget cuts and a worsening economy. You have 2 kids and a wife all of whom you love. You are applying via indeed, linkedIn and all of the sites that you can find. You are scared that you are going to have to move your family who loves Utah county for a job that is far away. Finally a friend mentions the Snow Capped Chambers website. There you are able to not only connect with buisnesses and buisness owners, but also the community and find help through new friends and a community with open arms.</p>
            <p>You are a mother who was working before the pandemic, but took a break after being furload. You decide that now is the time to jump back in. The kids are used to school again and you know that everything would be fine at home. You had heard from one of your kid's teachers about the Snow Capped Chambers and decide to look it up. Only to find that it has many jobs and offers just waiting for a person with you skill set.</p>
            <p>You are the head of a non-profit organization looking to give back to the community by running a clothes drive for those less fortunate. You dont know how to get out there though and want a way to reach out to your friends, family, coworkers, and neighbors. Then one of your coworkers mentions the Snow Capped Chamber and you not only find support but that local leaders are also there and can help you get a park and time to run this drive. It is nothings short of a miracle!</p>
            <p>You are the CEO of relitively new company. You were well founded enough to not fall apart during the pandemic, but you did have to let go of many of your employees and now your codeing bootcamp is ready to grow. So you need to find some new blood. You want someone local to the Utah County region so you find the Snow Capped Chamber. There is a community there that you can reach out to not just with jobs, but with publicity too. Due to this you find 3 great new employees and a new stream of customers.</p>
            <p>You are an entreprenuer that has come up with a great idea while in covid. You havent had time to implement it yet though, because as soon as the pandemic ended you had to go back to work to provide for you life. Now that things have began to have more structure in your life (like wearing pants) you are ready to embark on a new chapter of your life. You just need to find a way to get out there. Hopefully a mentor, support and customers. That is when you remember that your spouse found some jobs from a site online called the Snow Capped Chamber. You go online and find everything that you wanted. There is an entreprenuer that can help you on your journey and provide support and there are plenty of potential customers for your product to network with.</p>
